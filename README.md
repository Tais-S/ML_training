# The Cure Discography analysis

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore the data and apply some techniques frequently used in Data Science.

##Description
**The Cure** is one of my all-time favourite groups. When I found out there is a dataset of their discography I knew
I had to play with it. The data for this project is taken 
from *[here](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/the-cure-discography)*. You can also read the features description there.

Much of the work involved in analyzing data consists of looking at it and preparing for analysis. This includes 
tasks like making plots, transforming categorical variables, handling of missing data. The next step is 
to make predictions using the data. This covers choosing the prediction model and its parameters, 
fitting the model and assessing the results.
